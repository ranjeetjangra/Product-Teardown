## Cisco NSO Product Teardown

Cisco NSO (Network Service Orchestrator) is a model-driven service orchestration tool used to automate, configure, and manage networks across multi-vendor environments. Cisco NSO helps businesses move from one-time hardware sales to a subscription-based licensing model, enabling innovation in AI/ML network automation.

## Here's a breakdown of the product:

## Target Audience

1.	**Telecommunication Service Providers (Telcos):** NSO aligns with complex, multi-vendor architectures, attracting ISPs by reducing configuration/service provisioning costs and Time-to-Market for various services. Examples include Airtel, Vodafone, du, Etisalat, STC, and AT&T.
2.	**Large Enterprises with Multi-vendor Networks:** These enterprises need vendor-agnostic solutions to simplify operations. Examples: General Electric and JP Motors.
3.	**Managed Service Providers (MSPs):** MSPs require tools to streamline network provisioning and reduce manual errors4. Examples: Orange and TCS.
4.	**Government and Public Sector Organisations:** These organisations often have mission-critical networks with stringent requirements. Example: U.S. Department of Defence (DoD)

## Competitive Features & Market Fit Differentiation

- **Service Orchestration:** Enables service lifecycle management (creation, updates, deletion)
- **Multi-vendor Support:** Works with most network devices using standardised models (YANG)
- **Transactional Integrity:** Ensures changes are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID).
- **Real-Time Configuration:** Allows instant network updates with minimal downtime.
- **Integration with APIs:** Offers northbound REST/NETCONF APIs for seamless integration.

## Competitive Architecture
- **Core Engine:** Built on a YANG-based model-driven architecture.
- **Device Abstraction Layer:** Provides multi-vendor abstraction.
- **Transaction Manager:** Manages and validates configurations.
- **LSA**: Addresses scalability in large networks.
- **CDB**: Provides a robust mechanism for managing configurations.

## Monetisation Strategy

The Monetization Strategy of Cisco NSO (Network Services Orchestrator) leverages its positioning as a premium network automation and orchestration tool. Cisco focuses on several key areas to generate revenue from NSO:
- **Subscription-Based Licensing :** Ensuring a recurring revenue stream. Customers pay based on their usage and scale. E.g. $100k/year/Instance and separate cost if No. of managed devices crosses the agreed threshold.
- **Professional Services :** Cisco provides Implementation Support by customizing NSO for specific network environments. E.g. Sprint based development cost for NSO service package use cases, cost depend on how complex the use case is and how many sprint it will take.

## Weaknesses

- **Complexity:** Beginners might find it challenging to learn.
- **Cost:** Licensing is expensive compared to open-source alternatives.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Large-scale deployments might experience delays if not optimised.
